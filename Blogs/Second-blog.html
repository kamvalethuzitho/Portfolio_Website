        It's been almost two months since I got laid off from a job I genuinely enjoyed—both the work and the amazing team I had the privilege of working with.

        In the past three months, I’ve applied for over 500 jobs, yet I haven't had much luck—no interviews, and certainly no positive feedback. The reality of it all is tough. There have been moments where I felt completely hopeless, applying to roles just for the sake of it, with no real expectation that something would come through.
        
        I can't count how many times I’ve felt burnt out and mentally exhausted by the weight of unemployment. It takes a toll—not just financially, but emotionally too.
        
        Still, I keep going. I’m actively searching, though my strategy has changed. I’ve stopped limiting myself to tech roles and am now applying for anything that can help me pay the bills. Survival mode, if you will.
        
        Then there’s the debt. When you make plans for your future, you never imagine you’ll wake up one day to find out you’ve been laid off. You plan because you believe in building something long-term. You want to grow in your job, climb the ladder, and make it work. But life—and often the company you work for—can have other plans.
        
        Since getting laid off, I’ve often wondered: Are these decisions really well thought out? What about our dreams? Our goals? The people who depend on us?
        
        It’s painful—but unfortunately, it’s a reality many of us face. When it happens, all you can do is dust yourself off, start looking again, and remain hopeful that the same God who opened that last door will open another.
        
        Life is uncertain, and nothing can truly prepare you for its curveballs. Sure, savings can help you stay afloat—for a little while. But not forever. Financial literacy is key. It teaches you to plan for these moments and to understand just how broke you can get if you don’t secure a job in three months. The hard truth? Your bills won’t wait, and your debts won’t pay themselves.
        
        Being laid off is stressful and incredibly draining. But in times like these, you have to treat job hunting like a full-time job.
        
        Here’s what’s helped me stay grounded and productive:
        
        Set a goal to send out at least 10 job applications a day.
        
        Tailor your CV to each job you apply for—yes, every single one.
        
        Be intentional. Make sure your application reflects the effort you want them to see.
        
        Craft a compelling cover letter to accompany your CV.
        
        And on good days? Double that number.
        
        Because the truth is, your life does depend on this. So keep pushing. Stay consistent. And know that you’re not alone.
